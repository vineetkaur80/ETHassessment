# My Token
 This is the first token I created using Solidity that demonstrates the basic syntax and functionality of the solidity programming language. MyToken, is a basic implementation of a token contract with minting and burning functionalities. 
## Description
This program is a simple contract written in Solidity, a programming language used for developing smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.This program serves as a simple and straightforward introduction to Solidity programming, and can be used as a stepping stone for more complex projects in the future.
## Getting Started 
### Executing program
To run this program, you can use Remix, an online Solidity IDE. To get started, go to the Remix website at https://remix.ethereum.org/.
  Once you are on the Remix website, create a new file by clicking on the "+" icon in the left-hand sidebar. Save the file with a .sol extension (e.g., MyToken.sol). 
  To compile the code, click on the "Solidity Compiler" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Make sure the "Compiler" option is set to "0.8.4" (or another compatible version), and then click on the "Compile MyToken.sol" button.

Once the code is compiled, you can deploy the contract by clicking on the "Deploy & Run Transactions" tab in the left-hand sidebar. Select the "MyToken" contract from the dropdown menu, and then click on the "Deploy" button.
So, by following above steps we can create tokens using solidity on online platform like Remix IDE to implement code. After implementation we can deploy it.
